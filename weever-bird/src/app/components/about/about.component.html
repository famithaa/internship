        <h2>Meet the Artist</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm [Your Sister's Name], the hands and heart behind Handmade Happiness Crochet.</p>
        
        <p>My journey with yarn began over [X] years ago when my grandmother taught me the basics of crochet. What started as a hobby quickly blossomed into a passion that allows me to share my creativity with the world.</p>
        
        <p>Each piece I create is crafted with love and attention to detail. I believe that handmade items carry a special energy ‚Äì the care and intention that goes into making something by hand creates an item that's more than just functional or beautiful, but meaningful.</p>
        
        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>I work primarily with sustainably sourced, high-quality yarns to create pieces that are both beautiful and durable. Whether I'm designing a cozy blanket, a playful stuffed animal, or a stylish accessory, I put my whole heart into every stitch.</p>
